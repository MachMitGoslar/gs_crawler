# Docker Build Pull Issue Fix

## Problem
In line 234 of the GitHub Actions workflow, when building containers, Docker Buildx was trying to pull base images from docker.io even though the images were already prepared locally in the previous step.

## Root Cause
- The "Prepare base images" step successfully pulls/builds base images and tags them locally (e.g., `gs_crawler/python_basic_crawler:test`)
- However, when `docker buildx build` runs, it defaults to pulling images from registries
- Even though we had the image locally, Docker was trying to pull `gs_crawler/python_basic_crawler:test` from docker.io
- This caused build failures or unnecessary network calls

## Solution
Added the `--pull=false` flag to the `docker buildx build` commands in both:
1. **test-container-builds job** (line ~234)
2. **test-integration job** (line ~390)

## What `--pull=false` does
- Forces Docker Buildx to use locally available images instead of pulling from registries
- Ensures that the base images we prepared in the "Prepare base images" step are actually used
- Prevents unnecessary network calls and potential pull failures
- Makes builds faster and more reliable

## Before vs After

**Before:**
```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --file Dockerfile.test \
  --tag gs_crawler_test/$container:test \
  --load \
  --cache-from=type=gha \
  --cache-to=type=gha,mode=max \
  .
```

**After:**
```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --file Dockerfile.test \
  --tag gs_crawler_test/$container:test \
  --load \
  --cache-from=type=gha \
  --cache-to=type=gha,mode=max \
  --pull=false \
  .
```

## Benefits
✅ **Faster builds**: No unnecessary image pulls  
✅ **More reliable**: Uses guaranteed local images  
✅ **Reduced network usage**: No registry calls for base images  
✅ **Consistent behavior**: Base images prepared in previous step are actually used  

This fix ensures that the workflow uses the base images we carefully prepared (either from GHCR or built locally) instead of trying to pull them again from docker.io.
