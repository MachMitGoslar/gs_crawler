# Docker Build Pull Issue Fix

## Problem
In line 234 of the GitHub Actions workflow, when building containers, Docker was trying to pull base images from docker.io even though the images were already prepared locally in the previous step.

## Root Cause
- The "Prepare base images" step successfully pulls/builds base images and tags them locally (e.g., `gs_crawler/python_basic_crawler:test`)
- However, when using `docker buildx build` with a remote builder context, the local Docker images aren't automatically available to the buildx builder
- Even with `--pull=false` and `--load` flags, Docker Buildx uses an isolated builder instance that doesn't have access to the local Docker daemon images
- This caused build failures or unnecessary network calls to docker.io

## Solution
**Switched from Docker Buildx to regular Docker build** for container builds that depend on local base images:

1. **Keep Docker Buildx for base images** (they need multi-platform support and registry push)
2. **Use regular `docker build` for container builds** (they need access to local base images)
3. **Added verification steps** to ensure base images are properly available in the Docker daemon

## Key Changes

### 1. Base Image Preparation (Enhanced)
```bash
# Verify the local tag exists after pull/build
docker images "$local_tag"
```

### 2. Container Build Method (Changed)
**Before:**
```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  --file Dockerfile.test \
  --tag gs_crawler_test/$container:test \
  --load \
  --cache-from=type=gha \
  --cache-to=type=gha,mode=max \
  --pull=false \
  .
```

**After:**
```bash
docker build \
  --file Dockerfile.test \
  --tag gs_crawler_test/$container:test \
  .
```

### 3. Added Debugging
```bash
echo "📋 Dockerfile.test content:"
cat Dockerfile.test

echo "📋 Available images before build:"
docker image list | grep -E "(gs_crawler|stuffdev)" || echo "No base images found"
```

## Why This Works

✅ **Regular docker build** uses the local Docker daemon directly  
✅ **No builder isolation** - has full access to locally tagged images  
✅ **Simpler and more reliable** for local image dependencies  
✅ **Still use buildx for base images** where we need registry features  

## Architecture

```
Base Images (buildx) → GHCR Registry → Pull & Tag → Local Docker Daemon
                                                         ↓
Container Builds (docker build) ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← Local Images
```

This hybrid approach uses the right tool for each job:
- **Docker Buildx**: For base images (needs multi-platform, registry push/pull, caching)
- **Docker Build**: For containers (needs local base image access, simpler requirements)

## Benefits
✅ **Reliable local image access**: Regular docker build sees all locally tagged images  
✅ **No buildx isolation issues**: Direct access to Docker daemon  
✅ **Better debugging**: Can verify images exist before build  
✅ **Maintains performance**: Still uses buildx for base images where needed  
✅ **Simplified troubleshooting**: Clearer error messages and logs
